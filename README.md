# ðŸ“˜ NEET RAG Helper

A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based study assistant built for NEET preparation. The system allows students to query their syllabus directly and get precise answers grounded in the textbook.  

## âœ¨ Features
- **Source Referencing**: Displays the exact page number from the textbook for every answer.  
- **Out-of-Syllabus Detection**: Identifies and flags queries that fall outside the NEET syllabus.  
- **Local Deployment**: Built with **Streamlit**, enabling a lightweight and interactive UI that runs locally without requiring cloud resources.  
- **Retrieval + Generation**: Combines document retrieval (keyword/semantic search) with language model generation to provide accurate, context-aware responses.  

This tool helps students save time, avoid misinformation, and focus on the most relevant study material.
